# Overworld Exploration
One of the most important things an adventuring party will do is to explore the wilderness around them, spending days or weeks outside the safety of their town. 

Traveling in the wilderness can be done either through a hexcrawl, however a pointcrawl may be appropriate for some settings. 

## Hexcrawl Procedures
The overland world outside the town is divided into a map covered with hexes, and the adventuring day is divided into four phases.
- morning
- afternoon
- evening
- night

Characters may travel through one Hex during each phase and at most four Hexes in a day.  

If characters do not rest at least once per day they will gain *Fatigue* in one of their inventory slots. 

In traditional RPG systems each hex consists of an area six (6) units across. This can be miles, kilometers or any other distance appropriate for the scale of your current play setting. 

Terrain, weather or other environmental factors may hinder or inhibit characters’ movement, induce *Fatigue*, or cause them to become *Lost*. 

### Getting Lost
If the party is traveling to a new hex, they have a 1 in 6 chance of getting lost. After the GM describes the general information in the Hex, the party must roll a D6. On a roll of 1 the party is lost.  

If the current hex contains bad weather, or rough terrain add an additional point to the D6 roll. (e.g bad weather is a 2 in 6 chance, bad weather and bad terrain is a 3 in 6 chance.)

If the party is lost, they must spend an additional phase trying to find their way, rolling a D6 with the appropriate modifiers for weather and terrain. Should the party failure their roll again, they gain a level of *Fatigue*. 

## An Adventuring Day
