# Overworld Exploration
One of the most important things an adventuring party will do is to explore the wilderness around them, spending days or weeks outside the safety of their town. 

Traveling in the wilderness can be done either through a hexcrawl, however a pointcrawl may be appropriate when players choose to *Interact* with *Features* for some settings or narrative elements. 

## Hexcrawl Procedures
The overland world outside the town is divided into a map covered with hexes, and the adventuring day is divided into four *Phases*.
- Morning
- Afternoon
- Evening
- Night

Characters may travel through one Hex during each *Phase* and at most four Hexes in a day.  

If characters do not rest at least once per day, or if they are out of water or food, they will gain *Fatigue* in one of their inventory slots. 

// Where do I want to put information regarding Fatigue? Do I describe it here?

In traditional RPG systems each hex consists of an area six (6) units across. This can be miles, kilometers or any other distance appropriate for the scale of your current play setting. 

Terrain, weather or other environmental factors may hinder or inhibit characters’ movement, induce *Fatigue*, or cause them to become *Lost*. 

### Getting Lost
If the party is traveling to a new hex, they have a 1 in 6 chance of getting lost. After the GM describes the general information in the Hex, the party must roll a D6. On a roll of 1 the party becomes lost.  

If the current hex contains bad weather, or rough terrain add an additional point to the D6 roll. (e.g bad weather is a 2 in 6 chance, bad weather and bad terrain is a 3 in 6 chance.)

If the party is lost, they must spend an additional *Phase* trying to find their way, rolling a D6 with the appropriate modifiers for weather and terrain. Should the party fail their roll again, each character gains a level of *Fatigue*, and must attempt to find their way again at a future *Phase*. 

Note: The party does not need to attempt to find their way immediately after becoming lost. The may choose to setup camp or forage, but they may not explore to find new locations, *Features* or leave the current hex until they find their way. 


## An Adventuring Day 
During each *Phase*, the party may take one of the actions listed below. At the start of each action, the GM or a member of the party shall roll on the Encounter Table to determine if an encounter occurs during that Phase's action. 

`Does this amount of encounter table rolling become too tedious and burdensome?`

### Available Actions
 - Travel
 - Explore
 - Forage
 - Setup Camp
 - Interact

### Travel
The party travels to a hex adjacent to one they are on. Locations and features such as terrain, mountains, rivers, etc. are revealed on the current hex and may be revealed on adjacent hexes per the GM’s discretion based upon sight or weather. For example the characters are likely to see a very high and well known mountain peak on an adjacent hex if the weather is clear. 


### Explore
The party explores the current hex revealing up to six (6) features such as ruins, towns, caves, hidden groves, etc per the GM’s discretion. 

One feature may be revealed per attempt.

Note: Hexes do not necessarily contain six features and a search could turn up no additional features. The GM may decide whether to keep the amount of features per hex hidden. 

### Forage
The party may choose to forage for plants, search for food or seek out fresh water if they are available on the current hex. Items may not be available depending upon the terrain and the GM’s discretion. 

#### Foraging for Plants 
Foraging is searching for plants or herbs useful for the creation of potions or used in magic. Some plants are only available in certain climates or locations. 

#### Searching for Food
Party members are required to consume one (1) ration worth of food per day. The party may choose to spend one phase searching or hunting for food. 

Party members are also required to drink one unit of water per day. 

Roll 1d6 to determine how many rations or units of water the party is able to recover while searching. The party may choose to spend more than one *Phase* searching for food. 

##### Terrain Modifier
| Terrain | Rations | Water |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Grassland | 0 | -1 |
| Forest | +2 | +1 |
| Coastal (Fresh) | +1 | N/A |
| Coastal (Salt) | +1 | -1 |
| Dessert | -1 | -2 |
| Mountainous | +1 | 0 |


### Setup Camp
The party sets up camp to prepare for a rest. The party must rest for at least one *Phase* per day or they will gain one level of *Fatigue*.   

If the party is undisturbed they are able to rest and party members lose all their *Fatigue* at the start of the next *Phase*.

If the party is disturbed during their rest with an encounter or with another disturbance such as severe weather, they may only detract 1d4 *Fatigue* for the party. Fatigue may be recovered in any combination per the party members. 

`Need to check on the Fatigue math here. `

### Interact
The party may choose to interact with one feature that they have discovered inside the Hex. This would typically be dungeon delving, approaching a town/village, lair exploration, a long NPC interaction, etc… 

Note: When interacting with a feature such as a dungeon the time spent exploring the dungeon can usually take place during this same phase unless your players explicitly state they will spend more than one *Phase* there. Remember that even if the party is only in a dungeon for an hour, they usually have to travel to and from that feature.

## Pointcrawl Procedures
A Pointcrawl can be used when players are interacting with a region inside hex, a feature such as a valley or town, or even inside a larger dungeon. 

Pointcrawls are defined by landmarks or points of interest that are connected by the routes use to travel to them . 

For example, when inside a larger city you might have a barracks located on the north end of the city, a the city market in the middle and the South Gate located on the south side of the city. 

When exploring inside of a hex square or when utilizing a regional map that may show multiple points of interest, a point crawl system may be used to accommodate for travel. 

Imagine a point crawl similar to a mind map, where important locations are identified as points or nodes. Those locations are connected with lines, that can range from roads, paths, overland travel, etc.
