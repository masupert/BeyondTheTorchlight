# Equipment
All characters start with one weapon and possibly armor. Roll on the tables below to determine the damage type and size of your weapon, and if you have armor. 

Weapons and armor are very expensive to make and maintain and have a cost to keep in a useable condition after each adventure. 


## Weapons 
### Weapon Damage Type
| 1d6 | Damage |
|:--|:--|
| 1-2 | Bludgeoning |
| 3-4 | Piercing |
| 5-6 | Slashing |


#### Melee Weapons
| Size | Damage | Melee Attributes  | Inventory Slot | 
|:--| :--| :--| :--| :--|
| Small | 1d4 | One-Hand, Hidden |  1 |
| Medium | 1d6/8 | One-Hand, Versatile |  2 |
| Large | 1d10 | Two-Hand |  3 |
| Oversized | 1d12 | Two-Hand, Reach |  4 | 

#### Ranged Weapons
| Size | Damage | Melee Attributes  | Inventory Slot | 
|:--| :--| :--| :--| :--|
| Small | 1d4 | One-Hand, Hidden |  1 |
| Medium | 1d6 | Two Hand |  2 |


### Attribute Descriptions
- **One-Hand:** Weapon must be wielded with one hand
- **Two-Hand:** Weapon must be wielded with two hands
- **Versatile:** Weapon can be wielded with one or two hands. Damage dice for single handed is 1d6 and for two handed is 1d8. 
- **Hidden:** Weapon can be concealed on a person, as they are wearing at least basic clothing. 
- **Reach:** Weapon has extended reach, player can attack into adjacent *Action Lane* a provided the environment will allow for the reach. 
- **Reload:** Weapon takes one action to reload after firing. 
- **Thrown:** Any weapon can be thrown, however unless it is explicitly a ranged weapon, the player must retrieve that weapon in order to regain its possession. Any thrown ranged weapon either returns to the player or the player carries multiples as necessary. 

Players do not need to track ammunition for any standard weapons, however the GM may ask them to track ammunition for any special, magic, or improvised weapons or ammunition.


## Armor
Roll on the tables below to determine your starting armor and its primary resistance. 

- Armor is an expendable resource that can be consumed when damage would be applied to one of your *Characteristics*. 
- When your total Armor Score reaches zero, your armor is broken and must be repaired.
- Different types of armor have resistances to types of damage. If an armor is resistant to a damage type, it does not decrease. 

Roll a 1d4 for *Armor* amount and then a 1d6 to determine the type of damage resistance the *Armor* has. 

| 1d4 | Armor Amount |
|:--|:--|
| 1 | +1 |
| 2 | +2 |
| 3 | +3 |
| 4 | None |  

| 1d6 | Resistance |
|:--|:--|
| 1-2  | Bludgeoning |
| 3-4 | Piercing |
| 5-6 | Slashing |


####  Example:
> Elsa has 3 Breath is wearing Medium Armor, resulting in a total of +3 Armor. Her armor is resistant to Piercing damage. She is shot with a bow and arrow for a total of 5 damage. Her armor absorbs 3 of that damage and does not decrease, with the remaining 2 damage points going against her Breath, decreasing it down to 1.  
> 
> On the next round she is hit with a Warhammer for Bludgeoning Damage for 4 damage. Her armor is not resistant to bludgeoning damage, so it absorbs 3 points, but is broken in the process, with the remaining 1 point of damage passed on to her Breath or her Fortitude Score. 

- Weapons take up an inventory slot equal to its amount either on the belt or in the Backpack. 

- Amount must be stored in the Backpack and cannot be worn on the belt. Armor takes up inventory slots equal to its Armor Amount, but does not decrease when it takes damage. 

- Helmets and shields do not take up inventory slots as long as they are worn. 

- Characters may hold a torch with a shield hand, but cannot wield another weapon or wield a two handed weapon. Inventory slots must be available to stow a shield.

- Broken armor and shields can be discarded to free up inventory slots. 

## Repairing Weapons and Armor
- At the end of an adventure weapons and armor must be repaired. 

- Magic weapons and armor do not need to be repaired, but may need time to “recharge” abilities or armor.
