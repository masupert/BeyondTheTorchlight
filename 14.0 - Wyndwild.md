# 09.0 - Wyndwild

## Introduction
Beyond the Torchlight can be played in any setting, but the majority of adventures will be played in the Wynwild. The Wynwild is the wilderness located outside of civilization on the edge of an empire where you players will be setting up their town. 

## The State of the World
The world of BBTL is closely connected to two gods known as *Seros* and *Eluvia*. *Seros* and *Eluvia* are partners, enemies, lovers, separate beings and the same being all at once. Their aspects represent the two aspects of the world, the mortal realm (Moros) and the immortal realm (Wynwild). 

As the representative of the mortal realm Seros is the patron for death, the harvest, the hearth, domesticity, and time, amongst other things.

In order for the mortal realm to flourish it must pass through the cycle of the seasons, both literally and metaphorically. In order to do so Seros must be reborn to start a new cycle for the mortal realm. Seros has not died in an age and the waning light of humanity is stuck on the brink of decay and extinction. The world appears to be in a state of perpetual autumn, representing Sero’s decline and preparation for death. 

The resulting environment of Moros ranges from late summer’s golden hue to the cold rains of late fall. 

After Sero’s death a period of winter emerge in their absence and before their rebirth. 

Eluvia is the goddess of the immortal lands and the fae realm. She represents the the eternal and the unchanging. She is the other half of Seros, serving both as their spouse, mirror image, and counterpart.

Eluvia represents the dream world, eternity, the stars, wonder, learning, and the unchanging characteristics of the world and infinity.

After Sero’s death Eulvia must bare Sero’s out of the Wynwild and back to the mortal plane for their rebirth. 

## The Wynwild
The Wynwild, also called the “Wind”, “Vin” or “Vin-Vald” by some inhabitants, is a wilderness in which the immortal realm and the mortal realm are in conflict and merging.

The Wynwild consists of most of the wilderness outside the empire. It’s wild, untamed, beautiful and dangerous. Pockets of humanity live in the Wynwild as either small bastions of the Empire, trying to exert their influence or as worshippers of the Wyn itself. 

The Wynwild is under the domain of Eluvia. Some in humanity worship Eluvia directly while others fear them. 

As the Wynwild merges into the mortal realm, the land where the two meet changes. A town or location may move and change location slightly from when it was last seen. Very frequently locations that existed in one realm will move to the other, resulting in ruins or locales that may exist at some times and not others. 

## Campaign Questions
- Why is the Wynwild coming into the mortal realm?
- Is Eluvia angry, jealous, curious for the incursion?
- Is Eluvia the cause of the incursion into the mortal realm?
- Where is Eluvia? 

## The Wyndid, creatures of the Wynwild
Creatures of the Wynwild are know as Wyndid. They are often beautiful, horrific, kind, cruel and everything in-between. In almost all cases they are magical, able to manipulate forces well beyond those of any mortal. 

In some cases, the Wyndid become corrupted by their existence in the mortal realm. 

## The Empire
The Empire is the largest entity for humanity that currently remains, holding on to keep humanity alive and surviving until the rebirth of Seros. It is currently losing the battle as the Wynwild continues to consume Moros. 

The Empire is lead by the Order of the Sun, a religious order that serves Seros and seeks to ensure humanity’s survival.  The Order of the Sun believes that the fae realm has no place in the mortal realm.

The Empire is fighting against the spread of the Wyndwild into the mortal realm and they are losing. The Wyndwild expands further day by day into the mortal world and they believe that the fae and any who associate with them must be corrupted. 

### Campaign Questions
- Does the Empire truly serve in the interest of Seros?
- Where is Seros?  

## Religion and the Thousand Gods 
### The Order of the Sun
The Order of the Sun is the predominant religion and authority of the empire claims to follow an orderly and virtuous belief system, claiming that obedience, dedication, and devotion to Seros is the path to the mortal realm’s survival.  

This obedience and dedication requires a tremendous amount of resources in the form of money, people, and materials. Some people have begun to question if the the opulence of the Order is truly necessary. 

- Why is the world stuck in Autumn and why hasn’t a new age been born? Does the Order know?
- What is the order’s view of Eluvia?

### The Solar Reformation
A small splinter order has begun outside of the Order of the Sun who is dissatisfied the the Order’s opulence and corruption. Humanity is after all losing to the Wynwild. The Solar reformation offers a conservative and pious view of Seros and their worship. Their beliefs are more severe than the Order’s in most instances. They are viewed as zealots by some but as reformers by others. They have only recently caught the attention of the Order of the Sun as a serious threat. 

## The Thousand Gods
Even before the formation of the Empire and the incursion of the Wynwild into the mortal realm people all over the land worshiped other deities in various aspects. These range from fae creatures from the Wynwild or mortal heroes. Some of their worship is as small as that of a single household, but in every instance they are believed by their followers to hold power and sway. 

With the incursion of the Wynwild into the mortal realm some of these gods have become corrupted or found more power and followers than they ever believed possible. Others have recognized the Wynwild incursions as a threat and seek to protect or shield their followers.

Up until the incursion the Order of the Sun largely tolerated the worship of these other gods, viewing them as various aspects of Eluvia or Seros. Opinions inside the Order are changing by some parties. 

The Solar reformation believes all of these gods to be corrupted forms as a result of the incursion.
