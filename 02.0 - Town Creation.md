# Town Creation
When setting off in to the wilderness to you will first need to setup a new town before you creature your character. Each player at the table will contribute to the creation of a town by developing multiple characters/families. Each player will then be able to use any character they have created for adventuring. 

To create a set of characters each player will roll a full set of seven standard TTRPG dice. All players at the table will roll their dice at the same time onto the table. Where the dice land will determine the shape of the town and the location of each character’s home/business. 

If a new player joins the game or a player has lost all their character’s they may re-roll their dice again to create new characters, homes, and businesses. The homes of dead characters can live on as abandoned, haunted, occupied  by the remaining family or purchased by a new character.  

Starting with the Highest d20 roll, each player will assign a character or profession to each of the dice on the table. The  player’s main character will be assigned to the building in their dice roll with the highest score on the dice. This may or may not be their d20 dice. 

For any dice that have rolled a six (6) or higher, the player may roll on the *Profession* table to assign a trade/profession to the building. 

Any dice with a six or lower is automatically labeled as a “Laborer”. These characters can still be playable characters.
