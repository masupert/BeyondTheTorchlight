# Town Creation
Roll all of your dice for all characters onto the game table or your playmat. 

Starting with the Highest D20 roll, each player will assign a character or profession to each of the dice on the table. The  players main character will be assigned to the building in their dice rolls with the highest score. 

For any dice that they have rolled that is a six (6) or higher, the player may roll on the *Trade* table to assign a trade/profession to the building. 

Any dice with a six or lower is automatically labeled as a “Laborer/Farmhand” and will not be a character with a specific professional background.
