# Character Creation

## Name, Background and Traits
- Choose a name for your character
- Roll 1d6 for your Breath
- Roll 3d6 “Down the Line” for your Characteristics
- Roll 1d6 for each Trait

## How does health work?
Health in *Beyond the Torchlight* is comprised of both a character's *Breath* and their *Characteristics*. If any *Characteristic* reaches zero, then a character is dead.

## Breath
Breath reflects your character's ability to withstand the rigors of combat or avoid damage.

- **Roll 1d6 to determine your character's starting *Breath.***

Breath is not your character's health, but is their ability to act during intense situations. Damage taken by the character is first applied to their *Breath* before it is subtracted from the appropriate characteristic. 

- Once a player reaches zero (0) breath, any additional damage is applied to the appropriate *Characteristic*. 

- At the conclusion of combat or a strenuous activity, characters may rest for ten (10) minutes to “catch their breath" and restore their points. 

- If the characters are carrying any *Fatigue*, they may only recover 1/2, rounded down.

## Characteristics and Target Numbers
*Characteristics* represent a character's innate abilities, their physical capability, and mental acuteness. Characteristics are comprised of two numbers, which when added will total 20. 

- **Roll 3d6 to determine the value for each of your *Characteristics***.  

- The total on the dice represents the Difficulty Check (DC) for that Characteristic. The DC is the number other players must beat when they roll against you. 

- Twenty (20) minus your DC represents your Saving Throw (ST). The ST is the number you must beat when doing something risky. 

Characters will always roll dice if they are the ones taking an action. They will either roll to beat another character’s DC or roll a ST if there is a risk to themselves. 

#### Example
> Player 1 rolls 3d6 for their character Elsa's Strength, Agility, and Fortitude with the following results: 11, 13 and 5. 
> 
> | Characteristic | Difficulty Check | Saving Throw |
> |:--|:--|:--|
> | Str | 11 | 9 |
> | Agl | 13 | 7 |
> | Frt | 5 | 15 |
> 
> A thief is trying to pickpocket Elsa, but Elsa is pretty dextrous meaning that she has a high chance of detecting the thief trying to pickpocket her. The thief will roll 1d20 and must beat Elsa’s DC of 13 in order to be successful. The thief rolls a 9 and is caught by Elsa. The thief turns and makes a run for it sprinting across a roof top and jumping to the next building. 
> 
> Elsa pursues the thief and makes a jump across the gap between the buildings. This is a dangerous jump so Elsa will need to make a Saving Throw to see if she makes it. She needs to roll a 7 or higher on her Dex to successfully make the jump. She rolls an 11 and successfully jumps over the gap. 


### Taking Damage
When characters take damage while adventuring, the damage will first be applied to their *Breath*, until it reaches zero and any additional damage, will be applied to one of their *Characteristics*.

Characters will use their *Characteristics* to make checks or saves in situations that may have consequences. 

Characters can take a ten (10) minute rest to regain their *Breath*, but can only restore their *Characteristics* by sleeping in a bed in town, drinking a potion, or by finding a *Refuge* in the wilderness.

The *Characteristics* are as follows:

| Characteristic | Checks & Saves  | Damage Types  |
|:--|:--| :--|
| Strength | Requiring physical power or strength |Physical damage such as bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing |
| Agility | Requiring speed or reflexes | Cold, lightning, radiant, thunder |
| Fortitude | Requiring willpower, endurance, resilience, resistance or constitution. | Fire, poison, force, acid, stench|
| Cunning | Requiring mental acuity, perceive one's surroundings, manipulate or deceive people | Psychic, necrotic, curse, hallucination, rage, fragrance, charm, addiction |

The above damage types are not the only types of damage that may apply and your GM may have other types of damage. 


## Traits and Proficiencies
In addition to their base *Characteristics*, players will have additional traits that can modify their *Characteristics* in certain situations. The characters will have traits that apply to the following categories:
- Personality
- Movement
- Perception

A character’s profession can also be used when appropriate to modify a *Characteristic*.

Traits will generally allow a character to gain additional information during role-play or may provide an *Enhancement* or *Impairment* when doing a task that requires a roll.  

### Special Traits and Skills  
As characters progress in their adventures, they can gain up to two additional positive traits or skills related to weaponry, alchemy, magic, or other specialized areas. These enhance their proficiency in specific tasks.  

- Traits or skills can be acquired through narrative role-play led by the GM, or through training, education, or similar methods.  
- Players may choose to "forget" a trait or skill if they exceed the two-trait limit.  
- Traits and skills must be specific. For example, a player can train in "swords," but not in broader categories like "fighting" or "weapons."  

### Enhancements and Impairments  
- *Enhancements* are temporary benefits, while *Impairments* are temporary drawbacks, applied during gameplay.  
- Both are progressive and can stack.  
- In role-play situations without dice rolls, the GM may provide or withhold information based on the relevant *Trait*. (See examples under *Adventuring*.)  

### Advancing and Training  
Characters can improve their abilities through training or accomplishments achieved during their adventures.  

Traits and skills progress through three levels of proficiency:  

| Proficiency  | Bonus | Time to Learn |  
|--------------|-------|---------------|  
| **Trained**  | +1d4  | 1 Month       |  
| **Expert**   | +1d6  | 1 Year        |  
| **Master**   | +1d10 | 10 Years      |  

Abilities can also be improved or gained from feats achieved during gameplay. For example, if a character rolls a *Precision Strike* on one of their attacks, and that attack kills a significant creature, they may have gained knowledge on the weak point of that creature and all attacks on that creature moving forward may be *Enhanced*
