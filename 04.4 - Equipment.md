# Equipment
All characters start with one weapon and possibly armor. Roll on the tables below to determine the damage type and size of your weapon and if you armor. 

Weapons and armor are very expensive to make and maintain and have a cost to keep them in a useable condition after each adventure.

## Armor


List 3 types of armor, one that is resistant to a specific damage type only. 

List weapons by general damage type and then damage dice. Give examples of weapons, but characters can choose any weapon as appropriate. 

- Padded Armor (Bludgeoning)
- Maille (Slashing)
- Leather (Slashing)
- Ring Mail
- Scale 
- Splint Armor
- Lamellar Armor
- Plate Mail (Resistant to all, but results in a decrease in some skill probably Dex) High cost


Magical Armors
- Stone Plate
- 

Do not need to track arrows


- Lamellar Armor: Lamellar armor is made up of small rectangular plates laced together in rows. While it offers flexibility and mobility, it can also provide decent resistance against piercing attacks, especially when constructed from sturdy materials like hardened leather or metal.
- Splint Armor: Splint armor consists of strips or splints of metal riveted to a backing material such as leather or cloth. While it primarily provides protection against slashing attacks, the overlapping nature of the splints can also offer some resistance against piercing attacks, especially when reinforced with additional padding or materials.

- Impact-Resistant Armor: This armor is designed to absorb and distribute the force of impacts, providing resistance against bludgeoning damage. It could be made of materials like thick layers of padded fabric, reinforced leather, or metal plates with cushioning underneath.
- Reinforced Maille: A type of armor made from interlocking metal rings, providing good resistance against cutting damage. It's typically constructed from steel or iron rings woven together tightly to form a protective layer against slashing attacks.
- Piercing-Proof Plate Armor: Plate armor constructed with specially hardened or thickened plates to resist piercing damage. It may have additional reinforcing elements or be made of materials like hardened steel or even exotic materials like dragon scales, providing excellent protection against piercing weapons such as arrows or spears.
- Crushing Shield: A shield reinforced with sturdy materials like thick wood, metal, or a combination of both, designed to absorb and deflect the force of blunt attacks. It offers resistance against bludgeoning damage and may have specialized padding or shock-absorbing materials on the inner surface.
- Dragonscale Armor: This armor is made from the scales of dragons or other similarly tough creatures, offering resistance to tearing damage. The scales are carefully affixed to a flexible backing material, providing protection against slashing and tearing attacks while still allowing for freedom of movement.
- Stoneplate Armor: Crafted from magically reinforced stone or enchanted metal, this armor provides exceptional resistance against smashing damage. It may be heavy but offers unparalleled protection against powerful blunt force attacks.
- Laceration-Proof Leather Armor: This armor is treated with oils, waxes, or magical enhancements to make it resistant to cutting and lacerating damage. It might be reinforced with hardened leather layers or enchanted to magically mend small tears and cuts.
- Bashing-Resistant Chainmail: Similar to reinforced maille, this armor is specifically crafted to withstand bashing attacks. It could feature thicker or denser rings and additional padding to absorb the impact of blunt force.
- Bruise-Resistant Padding: Light, flexible armor made from layers of quilted fabric or magically reinforced materials designed to absorb and disperse the force of impacts. It offers resistance against bruising damage and is commonly worn under heavier armor for additional protection.
- Rend-Proof Scale Armor: Armor made from overlapping scales of incredibly durable materials, such as enchanted metals or exotic creature hides. It offers resistance against tearing and rending attacks, providing excellent protection against claws, teeth, and similar natural weapons.
