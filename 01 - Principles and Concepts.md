## Introduction
*Beyond the Torchlight*  is a simple rules and role-play forward West Marches style adventure game.

Players act as adventurers who live in a town on the edge of the wilderness, far from civilization. They must help each other to build their town and find resources for survival. Those resources can be used for personal use, to improve themselves or to grow their own influence/business, to build and better the town, or send resources back to the civilized world to attract finished goods/services.

Players must venture out into the wilderness to find valuable treasure or other resources for their survival. Their town rests on the edge of the known world, with the nearest known civilized town days if not weeks away. 

## What is a West Marches Campaign? 
A West Marches campaign is a term popularized and originally developed by Ben Robbins. It was developed as a method to accommodate the unpredictable availability of his players and his own difficulties with designing adventures. 

There is no overarching story or plot and games can be run and played by multiple game masters and players in any combination. Adventures consist of sorties out from the safety of the town into the wilderness and can occur with any combination of players or if needed in parallel with other groups. 

Information and resources about the world are then gathered and brought back to the town and shared with the entire community. 

The further you adventure from the town, the greater the risk of the unknown, but the greater the reward. 

## Principles and Concepts
### Classless
*Beyond the Torchlight* is a classless system and player's abilities are not limited to a class. The equipment, tools and items they find while adventuring define their experience and abilities. 

It might be common for a character to change their equipment back in town to suit the adventure they are about to embark on. 

### Your​ ​sheet​ ​has​ ​no​ ​answers
To do something, describe your character doing it; if you need to roll, the GM will let you know. When presented with a problem, your character sheet will not provide you an instant solution. Look to the environment and investigate the situation by​ ​asking​ ​the​ ​GM​ ​questions. You will need to describe to the GM what you want to do and you may have traits or abilities that can enhance or inhibit that action. 

### Heroism​ ​is​ ​proven
Your characters aren’t heroes, they are adventurers setting out into the dangerous world to eke out a new life and find treasure. Rising to challenges they encounter in the world will be the events that define their life. 

The defining moments of your character’s life are not in their backstory, but in the events they have yet to face. 

### Combat​ ​is​ ​war,​ ​not​ ​sport
Don’t expect encounters to be “balanced”. Approach combat with as much trepidation and preparation you might in real life. Know when to run away and cut your losses. 

### Delight in the glory and loss
The world is a harsh mistress. Untold riches and wonders can be found out in the wilderness, but untold horrors and challenges also await. Be creative with the challenges set before you and revel in their success and eventual failure.
