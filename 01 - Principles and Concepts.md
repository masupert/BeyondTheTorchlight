## Introduction
*Beyond the Torchlight*  is a simple rules and role-play forward West Marches style adventure game.

Players act as adventurers who live in a town on the edge of the wilderness, far from civilization. They must help each other to build their town and find resources for survival. Those resources can be used for personal use, to improve themselves or to grow their own influence/business, to build and better the town, or sent back back to the civilized world to attract finished goods/services.

Players must venture out into the wilderness to find valuable treasure or other resources for their survival. Their town rests on the edge of the known world, with the nearest known civilized town days if not weeks away. 

## What is a West Marches Campaign? 
A West Marches campaign is a term popularized and originally developed by Ben Robbins. It was developed as a method to accommodate the unpredictable availability of his players and his own difficulties with designing adventures. 

There is no overarching story or plot and games can be run and played by multiple game masters and players in any combination. Adventures consist of sorties out from the safety of the town into the wilderness and can occur with any combination of players or if needed in parallel with other groups. 

Information and resources about the world are then gathered and brought back to the town and shared with the entire community. 

The further you adventure from the town, the greater the risk of the unknown, but the greater the reward. 

## What makes *Beyond the Torchlight* Different?
Almost any RPG system can be used to play a West Marches game


## Principles and Concepts
### Classless
*Beyond the Torchlight* is a classless system and player's abilities are not limited to a class. The equipment, tools and items they find while adventuring define their experience and abilities. 

It might be common for a character to change their equipment back in town to suit the adventure they are about to set forth on. 

### Death

### Fiction First
### Growth
Characters do not level up, but grow through their experiences in the world. New abilities and skills can be gained through the the equipment or challenges they face in the wilderness or through training and education back in town by spending their treasure. 
### Game Master Neutrality
### Player Choice
### Shared Objectives
### Players are in Control
Games happen when the players decide to do something. The players along with the GM should coordinate on the initiation of adventures and the players should decide where they want to go and organize an adventuring party.
