===

### Characteristics
*Characteristics* represent a character's innate abilities, their physical capability, and mental acuteness. Characteristics are comprised of two numbers, which when added will total 20.

- The total on the dice represents the Difficulty Check (DC) for that Characteristic. The DC is the number other players must beat when they roll against you. 

- Twenty (20) minus your DC represents your Saving Throw (ST). The ST is the number you must beat when doing something risky. 

- Characters will always roll dice if they are the ones taking an action. They will either roll to beat another character’s DC or roll a ST if there is a risk to themselves. 

The *Characteristics* are as follows:

| Characteristic | Checks & Saves  | Damage Types  |
|:--|:--| :--|
| Strength | Requiring physical power or strength |Physical damage such as bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing |
| Agility | Requiring speed or reflexes | Cold, lightning, radiant, thunder |
| Fortitude | Requiring willpower, endurance, resilience, resistance or constitution. | Fire, poison, force, acid, stench|
| Cunning | Requiring mental acuity, perceive one's surroundings, manipulate or deceive people | Psychic, necrotic, curse, hallucination, rage, fragrance, charm, addiction |

## Let’s Create a Character
Let’s create our first character. We’ll name her **Elsa**. 

### Basic Stats
- She rolls a 2 on the **Profession** table and takes the profession of “**Farmer**”.
- Next we roll a 2d4 for her *Breath* for a result of 3.
- Roll 3d6 for starting coin for a total of 9. That may decrease in a minute if we buy additional gear. 
- Let’s roll 3d6 for each *Characteristic* : We get the following results: **11 Str, 13 Agl, 5 Frt,** and **11 Cun**. 
- Next we’ll roll up her traits that may enhance her Characteristics. These also help you describe your character. 
	- Roll 1d6 on the *Personality* table. We rolled a 2, which gives us all of the traits in that row, so we get **Gritty, Elusive, Convincing and Charming** 
	- Continue for the other traits. We rolled a 5 for *Movement* and a 1 for *Perception*

### Equipment
Next we will roll for and buy some equipment. 
- I will roll 1d6 for the size of the weapon  and a 1d4 for my weapon damage type. I rolled a 3 and a 1, so I have an extended bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d8 damage and has reach.
	- Since Elsa is a farmer, I am going to flavor this to be a a staff. This will take up 3 slots on my belt. 
- Next I will roll for Armor
	- I will roll a 1d4 to determine if I have any body armor. I rolled a 1 and have 1 armor.
	- I next roll a 1d6 to see what type of damage it is resistant to. I roll a 5, so it is resistance to **Slashing** damage. 
- Finally, let’s buy some equipment. Every character may choose to start with 3 days of rations, a bedroll, and a torch at no cost. Each takes one inventory slot in the backpack. 
- Elsa has 9 coin.
	- We’ll spend 1 coin for a tinderbox and 3 coin for some Lockpicks. We’ll put the Lockpicks on our belt so we can easily access them, and leave the tinderbox in the backpack. 
	- We have 5 coin remaining, which we will write on the sheet. 

So let’s describe Elsa based upon the traits we have for her and her profession. 

## Elsa’s Description
> Elsa is a resilient farmer with tanned skin that tells stories of long days under the sun and brown hair perpetually tied back, streaked with the dust of the fields. Her piercing, alert eyes rarely miss a detail, and her **astute** observations make her a formidable conversationalist. She carries herself with a **bracing** charm, her **witty** remarks often disarming even the most stubborn negotiators at the market.
> 
> Elsa's prized possession is an old, durable **helmet** passed down from her father, a relic from his time in the imperial army. She wears it during harvest as both a talisman and a practical tool for protection. Known for her **gritty** resolve, she is an **elusive** figure in the fields, **flicking** between rows of crops with a speed and purpose that leaves others in awe. Her ability to be **convincing** and **distracting** when needed has earned her both allies and wary respect among the townsfolk. Elsa’s strength isn’t just in **lifting** heavy sacks of grain but also in lifting spirits, rallying her neighbors with a keen sense of humor and unshakable determination.

# Gameplay  
## Rolling the Dice
### When to Roll
- If a character asks a question the answer should  be given if available without a roll required. 
- Rolls should only be used when there is risk involved with an action. 
	- Picking a lock does not require a roll, but picking a lock while a monster barrels down the hallway towards you may require a roll. 
- The character doing the action is always the one rolling the dice. They are either rolling against another character’s DC or rolling against their own Save score. 
- Ties always go to the player with the stat.
- Environmental challenges are always a Save.
- All checks and saves will be rolled with a single d20. 

### Enhancement and Impairment
 - An *Enhancement* or *Impairment* adds a 1d4 to a roll. 
 - *Enhancement* and *Impairments* can stack or cancel each other out. 
 - *Enhancements* and *Impairments* can apply to attacks and other actions during combat. 

## Using Characteristics and Traits
- Characteristics and Traits are generally not used during combat unless a check or save is required. 
- Character’s *Profession* or *Traits* can provide them insight to a situation without an additional roll (see Examples)
---
## Adventuring & Delving
- Each day is divided into four phases (morning, afternoon, evening, and night).
	- Player’s must rest one phase per day or they will gain a level of Fatigue in one inventory Slot
	- Completing a rest removes all Fatigue or if the party is disturbed 1d4 Fatigue for the party. 

### Fatigue
- If characters are unable to sleep, are deprived of a critical resource, or challenged with an extreme condition such as weather, they will gain a level of *Fatigue*. When a character gains *Fatigue* it is added to one of their inventory slots. If they have no open slots available, they must drop a piece of equipment to free up an inventory slot.
- The slot can be either on their belt or their backpack. 

### Delving Rounds
- When delving in a dungeon, mansion, etc. play will proceed in 10 minute rounds. 
- Torches, candles and lanterns last for 1 hour per use.
- Light sources come with a cost in a dungeon. If standing inside a light source, any dim light outside the light source becomes darkness. 
	- Torches cast a 20’ radius only, and smoke.
	- Candles cast a 5’ radius
	- Lanterns cast a 60’ beam, 5’ wide. 
#### Dim Light
- The players cannot see in the dark, but the monsters can. 
- Dim Light shows only fuzzy outlines of objects or creatures. 
- Any attack made upon a creature in Dim Light is *Impaired*, including ranged attacks. 
- Any attack from Dim Light into light is *Enhanced*.

--- 
## Combat
### Initiative
- Initiative is determined only for the first round with each player rolling an *Agility Save*. Upon failure the character does not act until the next round.
- Combat proceeds in turns each round. Player, GM, then Environment. 
- Damage, conditions, etc. only go into effect at the end of the round, including *Incapacitation/Death*.
- Characters can make one *Action* and one Move during combat. 
### Actions
Types of actions include but are not limited to:
- *Stance Ability* 
- Attack, Trip, Push, etc. 
- Interact with the environment
- Administer an item or potion to a companion
- Access your backpack. 

Items on your belt can be used and handled freely without the use of an *Action*. 

### Stances
#### Aggressive
- +2 to any damage dealt.
- Ability: *Intimidate* - Any enemies in current action lane are *Impaired* for their next attack. 
#### Steadied
- Cancel one *Impairment* on your character when in this Stance. 
- Ability: *Rally* - Adjacent players recover 1d4 Breath immediately.
#### Defensive
- -1 to any damage received. 
- Ability: *Protect* - Absorb 1/2 damage from any adjacent player.
#### Rearguard
- May *Retreat* if not *Engaged* and take no damage that round.
- Ability: *Suppression* - No damage dealt, but may prevent a character from moving lanes, going into/out of hiding, or Retreating combat.  

### Engagement
Any character that shares an *Action Lane* with at least one enemy is *Engaged*. If a character is *Engaged* they will take damage plus one *Enhancement* for each attack received in the round. 

 The nearest *Engaged* enemy is the enemy in the closest stance to the character and in the same Action Lane. A character can step in front of companion to pull engagement upon themselves and allow their companion to *Retreat*. 
 
 Some weapons, magic items or effects may affect only *Engaged* characters. 
 
 Players in the *Rearguard* position can attack any position, but cannot impart engagement upon a character. 

### Movement 
- Characters can move to any *Combat Stance* or *Action Lane* that is on the same level as them.
- If an *Action Lane* is higher or lower in elevation, under dense cover, or has any other feature that provides *Enhanced* or *Impaired Attacks*, then the character can only move into that *Action Lane* from an adjacent lane. 

###  Damage, Dying and Death
When a character takes damage it is first applied to any *Breath* that they may have. Once a character’s *Breath* has been exhausted any remaining damage is applied to the appropriate *Characteristic*. 

If a character takes damage to a Characteristic, they must make a Saving Throw, rolling against the value of that Characteristic. Upon failure, they are *Incapacitated*

 Characteristic | Saves & Checks  | Damage Types  |
|:--|:--| :--|
| Strength | Requiring physical power |Physical damage such as bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing |
| Dexterity | Requiring speed or reflexes | Cold, lightning, radiant, thunder |
| Wilpower | Requiring endurance, resilience, resistance or fortitude. | Fire, poison, force, acid, stench|
| Sanity | Requiring mental acuity or abilities to perceive one's surroundings | Psychic, necrotic, curse, hallucination, rage |
| Luck | Requiring manipulation of people, to deceive, interrogate, or manipulate |Fragrance, charm, gluing, healing, seduction, addiction, withdrawal |

When a character is *Incapacitated* they fall prone to the ground and cannot take any actions. During their turn they may drag themselves one unit of measure (i.e. 5 feet, 1 meter, one combat square, etc.) in any direction.

---
## Examples of Play
### Difficulty Check and Saving Throws
>Elsa: 11(9) Str, **13(7) Agl,** 5(15) Frt, 11(9) Cun

> A thief is trying to pickpocket Elsa, but Elsa is pretty dextrous and has good Agility meaning that she has a high chance of detecting the thief trying to pickpocket her. The thief will roll 1d20 and must beat Elsa’s DC of 13 in order to be successful. The thief rolls a 9 and is caught by Elsa. The thief turns and makes a run for it sprinting across a roof top and jumping to the next building. 
> 
> Elsa pursues the thief and makes a jump across the gap between the buildings. This is a dangerous jump so Elsa will need to make a Saving Throw to see if she makes it. She needs to roll a 7 or higher on her Agl to successfully make the jump. She rolls an 11 and successfully jumps over the gap. 

### Adventuring and Delving
> Riddic, Elsa, Tahula, and Breyer enter a room. The room an appears to be an old library that is in disrepair. Three of the walls are lined with bookshelves, many of which have fallen onto the floor and are damaged with age and rot. In the center of the room is a large oak table. Lying upon the table is an open red leather bound book, which does not appear to show any signs of age or damage. 
> 
> On the far side of the room hangs a large faded tapestry covering the far wall. 

In this scene the items of interest for the party are clearly pointed out via the tapestry and the book lying on the table. The players are provided this information outright. The players may choose to explore the room in detail. 


> Riddic’s profession is a “Scholar”, so he states that he would like to investigate and find more out about the book on the table by reading it.  Riddic’s background as a Scholar provides an *Enhancement* which may provide additional information on the book or the writing without any additional roll required. 
> 
> Breyer states that his profession is an “Artisan” and he would like to investigate the tapestry on the far wall. He also has an *Agility* trait of “Astute”. He gains two *Enhancements* which would provide him two additional pieces of information . As he approaches the tapestry he immediately realizes that the tapestry is trapped because of his Astute trait. As an Artisan he is able to interpret the scene in the tapestry as the solution to the trap and is able to pull the required threads on the tapestry to release the trap and have the tapestry roll up without any damage, revealing a hidden passage on the wall. 

If another player approaches the tapestry, but does not have any background or traits that may apply to the investigation, the player should state to the GM exactly what they wish to do. 

> Elsa may say, “I would like to look at the tapestry and see if there is anything behind it or if it is trapped. If she asks these questions the GM should provide the information. 
> 
> If she does not ask these questions and interacts with the tapestry, the trap may be triggered and she may be asked to make a *Save* and possibly roll for an encounter. 

### Combat

Combat Example -1.png
 
Riddic, Elsa, Tahula, and Breyer are in a tavern and a fight breaks out with a group of bandits. The party rolls for *Initiative*, with everyone succeeding their Agility Save except Tahula.

The top two Action Lanes represent a balcony inside the tavern. Attacks from the balcony to other Action Lanes are *Enhanced* and attacks from the ground floor to the Balcony are *Impaired*, due to the elevation.

Combat Example -2.png

- Riddic moves forward to an Aggressive stance, pulling out his Battle Axe and attacking Bandit #5 for a total of 8 damage. 

- Elsa remains in the Steadied stance and takes a shot with her hand crossbow at Bandit #3. She rolls max damage (6) on her crossbow resulting in a *Precision Strike*. She rolls her damage dice again for a total of 10 damage.

#### Round 1: Turn 2 - Bandit Turns

Combat Example -3.png

- Bandit #1 moves forward to an *Aggressive Stance* and attacks Thula with their sword. 

- Bandit #2 remains in place because they are *Suppressed*, but they throw a dagger from the second floor balcony at Elsa. The attack is *Enhanced*, due to their elevation on the second floor. 

- Bandit #3 is in an adjacent Action Lane to the balcony and can move up to the balcony on this turn. (If they were not in an adjacent lane, they would need to move to an adjacent lane first). They run up the balcony and throw a dagger at Breyer. 

- Bandit #4 stays in their *Steadied Stance* and attacks Elsa with their shortsword. They roll a *Precision Strike* and roll their damage dice again. 

- Bandit #5 moves forward to an *Aggressive Stance* and attacks Riddic. 

- Bandit #6 moves to the Rearguard stance and attacks Riddic with their shortbow.
