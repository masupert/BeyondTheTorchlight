# Magic and Alchemy

## Magic


## Alchemy
- In general a potion can alleviate most ailments, etc. 
- A potion can equal a spell of equivalent level based upon the number of different ingredients in the potion that share the properties required
	- For example, a potion to cure a level 3 poison, would require three different ingredients in it that can cure poison. 
	- A potion takes one full day per ingredient (not including bases) to make. 
	- If a lesser potion is taken for a high level ailment, the potion will decrease the ailment by the difference in points. 
	- Only one potion may be consumed per day per treatment. 
- Potions that require numbers or a dice roll will output 1d4 of their effect per different ingredient. 
	- The use of multiples of the same ingredient can increase dice value in the roll.
	- For example, a healing potion made with an Agrimony plant and a Horehound plant would deliver (1d4+1d4) healing. If the potion was made with two Agrimony plants and a HoreHound plant it would deliver (1d6+1d4 healing)
