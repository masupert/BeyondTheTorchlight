Masculine or Active herbs are those which are possessed of strong vibrations. These project energy outward and are used for protection, hex breaking, exorcism, lust, to maintain sexual potency, health, strength, courage, 

Feminine or passive herbs are plants which are quieter, subtler, softer in their effects. They are used to attract, increase beauty, recapture youth, aid in healing and in developing psychic powers, increase fertility, draw wealth, promote happiness and peace, aid sleep and spirituality, and cause visions.
