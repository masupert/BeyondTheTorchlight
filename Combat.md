# Combat
Combat is expected to occur one to two times per play session, but should not be considered as a preferred result of most *Encounters*. 

Combat is dangerous, especially in a world where access to a place to rest and heal could be days away. The GM should attempt to telegraph an encounter and provide players an opportunity to negotiate, avoid, sabotage or ambush their way through most encounters. However, the enemy may be as smart as the players and may also attempt to manipulate the situation or environment against the player characters. 

## Combat Grid
Combat in *Beyond the Torchlight* is abstracted to provide a cinematic feel. Combat scenarios can be played out either on a play-mat or on a traditional tabletop grid, however the grid is not used to represent physical locations within an environment. 

The *Combat Grid* is instead used to represent character’s combat stances along with the enemies that they may be engaged with. 

## Initiative 
When combat begins players should be asked to make a Dexterity Check to determine if they act with *Initiative* at the top of the first round of combat. If a player fails, they do not get to act until the next round of combat. 

Initiative is determined only for the first round of combat or for the round in which a player character joins combat. 

## Rounds
A round of combat generally consists of two turns. The player’s turns and the GM’s turn. After the Dexterity Check for the first round, all players will act simultaneously before the GM takes their turn. 

Each round, the PCs declare what they are doing before dice are rolled. If a character attempts something risky (such as jumping from a second story window), the GM may call for a check/save for appropriate players or NPCs.

Time during combat is abstracted and all characters involved in combat act and resolve their actions simultaneously. Damage is totaled and applied at the end of the each turn. A character who is *Incapacitated* during combat goes down at the end of the *Round*. 

Note: If required for mechanical reasons a round of combat takes 10 seconds of time, but can be extracted to larger increments of time per the GM’s discretion. 
 
## Turns
Combat proceeds with three *Turns* in each *Round*. The players always act during the first turn followed by the GM  and finally the environment. 

Under certain combat situations, environmental or other actions may occur at the end of the round. Lair actions, environmental effects or other actions not tied to the players or the enemies will occur after the GM’s turn and before the start of a new round. 

At the end of a round all characters will make any necessary *Saving Throws*. Those who fail will be *Incapacitated*.

## Actions
Characters make one action and make one move while in combat in any order they choose.  

Types of actions include but are not limited to:
- *Stance Ability* 
- Attack
- Interact with the environment
- Hand an item to a companion
- Speak up to 10 words
- Administer an item or potion to a companion

Additional actions such as a check/save or a *Maneuver* may occur depending upon the circumstances or a request from the GM.  

## Stances
| Stance | Effect | Ability | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Aggressive | +2 to all attack rolls done by the player | Intimidation | Player cannot attack this round. Nearest engaged enemy must attack while *Impaired*.*  |
| Steadied | +0 |Rally | Can only be completed once per round. Player cannot attack this round. All players within one adjacent position may gain 1d4 *Breath*  |
| Defensive | -1 to all attack rolls against the player |Protect Companion | Player can attack this round. May choose to defend one adjacent companion and absorb an attack taking 1/2 the damage of the attack.  |
| Rearward | |Called Shot | Takes 1 round to prepare. The next ranged attack is *Enhanced*.

### Engaged Enemies
The nearest engaged enemy is defined as the enemy closest in stance to the character and in the same lane. Any character in the same lane may be attacked with a melee weapon. Ranged weapons may attack any character in any lane. 

If a melee weapon has “reach” the character may attack the closest character in one adjacent lane. 

Melee weapons cannot attack from the *Rearward* stance and only ranged weapons may make a called shot.  

## Attacking
In order to make a melee attack a character must be in the same lane as the enemy on the combat grid to be engaged, or if a weapon has reach they may be on an adjacent lane. 

Ranged weapons may attack an enemy from any lane of combat. 

## Precision Strike (Critical Hit)
If a character rolls the highest number available on their damage die, they rolled  *Precision Strike*. They may roll an additional damage dice and take the total. 

A character may also choose to forgo the additional damage dice and take a *Maneuver* instead. 

`I think I like this a lot of crit hits as it gives "rogue" type characters with daggers a lot of utility since they are likely to crit hit more often.`
 

## Enhanced Attacks
When an attack is enhanced the player may add an additional 1d6 to their attack roll. Attacks can become enhanced due to various skills/abilities of the players or by environmental combat situations such as a surprise attack, attacking from an elevated position, etc. 

Instead of attacking with an additional 1d6 a player may choose to instead attack with their regular damage die and conduct a maneuver instead. You must declare a maneuver before rolling your damage dice. Some Maneuvers may be attempted with melee weapons only. 

## Impaired Attacks
When a character is impaired, their attack die is a d4. 

`Not sure if I currently like the enhanced and impaired mechanics. Need to explore other combinations here.`

### Martial Exploits (Maneuvers) 
#### Disarm
You disarm a target forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it is holding. This may include its mouth or other appendages. 
#### Distract
You distract the target allowing all attacks against that target for the next round to receive a +1 bonus. 
#### Evade
You can evade all attacks for the next round of combat, receiving damage only on a critical hit. 
#### Feint (Melee)
You feint, causing the enemy to hesitate. You may re-roll your damage die and take the higher result. 
#### Goad
You goad a single target into attacking you on the next round. The attack against you is *Enhanced* and any attack against another target is *Impaired*.
#### Grapple (Melee)
After your attack you attempt to grapple the creature with a Dex check. Upon success the enemy may not move and its attacks are impaired. The character grappling must make Str save each round to continue to hold the grapple. 
#### Hide
You hide provided there is a place to hide. Your next attack after coming out from hiding is *Enhanced*. You may hide for more than one round of combat.
#### Lunge (Melee)
You may lunge at a target increasing your range to attack an enemy in an adjacent lane, or if your melee weapon has range you may attack up to two lanes over. 
#### Parry (Melee)
You may choose to parry a melee attack from one enemy, avoiding all damage, including a critical hit. The enemy must make a melee attack against you next round. A *Maneuver* may still be enacted against you. 
#### Push (Melee)
You may push a character into one adjacent lane or stance. The character may not move from that position next round. 
#### Riposte

#### Trip
You may trip one character causing them to become prone. 


## Squads
Enemies and players may group up together in the same combat lane in three or more to act as a *Squad*. 
- Attacks against Squads by a single player are impaired
- Attacks by Squads against a single player are enhanced. 
- When attacking as a squad, all attackers roll their damage dice and you take the highest damage roll only to apply it. 

`Need to explore this concept more to determine if this makes sense as a separate mechanic or if it should just apply to all characters in a combat lane`

## Damage

### Ability Score Loss
### Incapacitated and Death
### Retreat
