## How does health work?
Health in *Beyond the Torchlight* is comprised of both a character's *Breath* and their *Ability Scores*. If any ability score reaches zero, then a character is dead.

## Breath
**Roll 1d6 to determine your character's starting *Breath***, which reflects your character's ability to withstand the rigors of combat or avoid damage.

Breath is not your character's health, but is their ability to act during intense situations. Damage taken by the character is first applied to their *Breath* before it is subtracted from the appropriate ability. 

Characters may also choose to spend some of their breath to take more drastic actions during combat, use combat abilities, or to cast spells. 

Once a player reaches zero (0) breath, any additional damage is applied to the appropriate ability score. 

At the conclusion of combat or a strenuous activity, characters may rest for ten (10) minutes to "Catch their breath" and restore their points. 

If the characters are carrying any fatigue, they may only recover 1/2, rounded down of their *Breath*

## Characteristics
*Characteristics* represent a character's innate abilities, their physical prowess, and mental characteristics. Characters will use their *Characteristics* to make checks or saves in situations that may have consequences. 

When characters take damage while adventuring, the damage will first be applied to their *Breath*, until it reaches zero and any continued damage, shall be applied to one of their *Characteristics*.

Characters can take a ten (10) minute rest to regain their *Breath*, but can only restore their *Characteristics* by sleeping in a bed in town, drinking a potion, or by finding a *Refuge* in the wilderness.

The *Characteristics* are as follows:

| Characteristics | Saves & Checks  | Damage Types  |
|:--|:--| :--|
| Strength | Requiring physical power |Physical damage such as bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing |
| Dexterity | Requiring speed or reflexes | Cold, lightning, radiant, thunder, falling |
| Wilpower | Requiring endurance,  resistance or fortitude. | Fire, poison,Force, acid, charmed, stench|
| Sanity | Requiring mental acuity or abilities to perceive one's surroundings. | psychic, necrotic, curse, hallucination |
| Luck | Requiring manipulation of people, to deceive, interrogate or manipulate |fragrance, gluing, healing, rage |


Roll 3d6 for each ability score in order and record the number. Characters may choose to swap two scores once.

- Personality
- Movement
- Perception

## Weapon Skills
As characters become successful in their adventures they may acquire up to two weapon, potion or magic skills to increase their proficiency.
