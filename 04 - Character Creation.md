## How does health work?
Health in *Beyond the Torchlight* is comprised of both a character's *Breath* and their *Characteristics*. If any Characteristic reaches zero, then a character is dead.

## Breath
**Roll 1d6 to determine your character's starting *Breath***, which reflects your character's ability to withstand the rigors of combat or avoid damage.

Breath is not your character's health, but is their ability to act during intense situations. Damage taken by the character is first applied to their *Breath* before it is subtracted from the appropriate characteristic. 

Characters may choose to spend their breath to take more drastic actions during combat, use combat abilities, or to cast spells. 

Once a player reaches zero (0) breath, any additional damage is applied to the appropriate characteristics. 

At the conclusion of combat or a strenuous activity, characters may rest for ten (10) minutes to "Catch their breath" and restore their points. 

If the characters are carrying any fatigue, they may only recover 1/2, rounded down.

## Characteristics and Target Numbers
*Characteristics* represent a character's innate abilities, their physical capability, and mental acuteness. Characteristics are comprised of two numbers, which when added will total 20. 

**Roll 3d6 to determine the value for each of your *Characteristics***.  The total on the dice represents the Difficulty Check (DC) for that Characteristic. The DC is the number other players must meet or beat when they roll against you. 

Twenty (20) minus your DC represents your Saving Throw (ST). The ST is the number you must meet or beat when doing something risky. 

Characters will only roll dice if they are the ones taking an action. They will either roll to beat another character’s DC or roll a ST roll if there is a risk to themselves. 

#### Example
Player 1 rolls 3d6 for their character Elsa's Strength, Dexterity and Wilpower with the following results: 11, 13 and 5. 

| Characteristic | DC Check | Saving Throw |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Str | 11 | 9 |
| Dex | 13 | 7 |
| Wil | 5 | 15 |

A thief is trying to pickpocket Elsa, but Elsa is pretty dextrous meaning that she has a high chance of detecting the thief trying to pickpocket her. The thief will roll 1d20 and must beat Elsa’s DC of 13 in order to be successful. The thief rolls a 9 and is caught by Elsa. The thief turns and makes a run for it sprinting across a roof top and jumping to the next building. 

Elsa pursues the thief and makes a jump across the gap between the buildings. This is a dangerous jump so Elsa will need to make a Saving Throw to see if she makes it. She needs to roll a 7 or higher on her Dex to successfully make the jump. She rolls an 11 and successfully jumps over the gap. 


### Taking Damage
When characters take damage while adventuring, the damage will first be applied to their *Breath*, until it reaches zero and any additional damage, will be applied to one of their *Characteristics*.

Characters will use their *Characteristics* to make checks or saves in situations that may have consequences. 

Characters can take a ten (10) minute rest to regain their *Breath*, but can only restore their *Characteristics* by sleeping in a bed in town, drinking a potion, or by finding a *Refuge* in the wilderness.

The *Characteristics* are as follows:

| Characteristic | Checks & Saves  | Damage Types  |
|:--|:--| :--|
| Strength | Requiring physical power |Physical damage such as bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing |
| Dexterity | Requiring speed or reflexes | Cold, lightning, radiant, thunder |
| Wilpower | Requiring endurance, resilience, resistance or fortitude. | Fire, poison, force, acid, stench|
| Sanity | Requiring mental acuity or abilities to perceive one's surroundings | Psychic, necrotic, curse, hallucination, rage |
| Luck | Requiring manipulation of people, to deceive, interrogate, or manipulate |Fragrance, charm, gluing, healing, seduction, addiction, withdrawal |

The above damage types are not the only types of damage that may apply and your GM may have other types of damage. 


## Traits
In addition to their base *Characteristics*, players will have additional traits that can modify their *Characteristics* in certain situations. The characters will have traits that apply to the following categories:
- Personality
- Movement
- Perception
- Background

## Special Skills
As characters become successful in their adventures they may acquire up to two weapon, potion or magic skills to increase their proficiency.  

`Need to define how this occurs mechanically. Is it that they gain a skill if they have a critical hit on the killing blow of a creature? `
