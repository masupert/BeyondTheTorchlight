# Delving
## Introduction
Delving is the process in which the characters leave the larger adventuring world and delve into a location such as a dungeon, mansion, or other specific location. 

Delving is divided into a series of turns. A turn represents either ten minutes of exploration time or the exploration of a single room or specific space. 

When not in combat the player  can do one “active” task per ten minute room/scene. A player cannot for example be talking to someone, while actively searching for a hidden door. 

All players in the party should get an opportunity to participate in a scene if they choose and they may offer to help a companion in a task that is occurring. 

- If a task requires a roll, each player helping will add an *Enhancement* (1d4) bonus to the roll. 
- Helping another player will typically count towards a character’s active task in a scene. 

It should generally be assumed that players will be looking for traps and hazards while exploring, and they do not need to state that they are doing so, unless they are under stress or moving recklessly. An example would be being chased by a monster down a hallway. 

## Dungeon Turns
Dungeon exploration is a delicate balancing act of managing resources, and making strategic decisions. The more time spent searching, and lingering in dangerous locations means that there is a higher probably of an encounter. *Encounters* can involve running into monsters, but can also operate as timers where access or resource availability may change. The object of the party’s hunt may no longer be in the room they expect it to be, if they take too long to get there. 


### Dungeon Turn Movement
- Characters can move carefully about 200 ft. in a 10 minute turn. 
-  Characters moving carefully spot signs of all traps. Traps should be designed to be disarmed or subverted with ingenuity and creative thinking using common sense and inventory. 
-  Characters can quickly move 600 ft. in a 10-minute turn. Characters moving quickly may get a chance to roll a *Save* to notice a trap. Otherwise, they may trigger a trap if it is concealed. 

## Searching
- When characters enter a room the GM should describe the obvious information of the room, including any points of interest that players may wish to investigate further. A quick search covers roughly a 30x30’ space, or one room.

- The players may spend 10 minutes (1 turn) to explore the room or location in detail.

### The Use of Skills and Characteristics
In most circumstances a roll to use a skill or characteristic shouldn’t be requested from the GM to find or explore locations. Players should be explicit in what they would like to search for. The GM should provide enough information in a scene to encourage players to explore the scene. 

*Skills* or *Characteristics* can and should still be used to judge how much additional information a GM may wish to provide from a character’s efforts. 

#### Example
##### GM Describes the Room:
> *Riddic, Elsa, Tahula, and Breyer enter a room. The room an appears to be an old library that is in disrepair. Three of the walls are lined with bookshelves, many of which have fallen onto the floor and are damaged with age and rot. In the center of the room is a large oak table, laying upon the table is an open red leather bound book, which does not appear to show any signs of age or damage.* 
> 
> *On the far side of the room hangs a large faded tapestry covering the far wall.* 

In this scene the items of interest for the party are clearly pointed out via the tapestry and the book laying on the table. The players are provided this information outright.

##### The players may choose to explore the room in detail. 

Riddic’s’s background is a “Scholar”, so he states that he would like to investigate and find more out about the book on the table by reading it. The GM can then describe the contents of the book. Riddic’s background as a Scholar provides and *Enhancement* which may provide additional information on the book or the writing without any additional roll required. 

Breyer states that his background is an “Artisan” and he would like to investigate the tapestry on the far wall. He also has an *Agility* trait of “Astute”. He gains two *Enhancements* which would provide him two additional pieces of information in the situation. As he approaches the tapestry he immediately realizes that the tapestry is trapped because of his Astute trait. As an Artisan he is able to interpret the scene in the tapestry as the solution to the trap and is able to pull the required threads on the tapestry to release the trap and have the tapestry roll up without any damage, revealing a hidden passage on the wall. 

If another player approaches the tapestry, but does not have any background or traits that may apply to the investigation, the player should state to the GM exactly what they wish to do. 

Elsa may say, “I would like to look at the tapestry and see if there is anything behind it or if it is trapped. If she asks these questions the GM should provide the information. 

If she does not ask these questions and interacts with the tapestry, the trap may be triggered and she may be asked to make a *Save* and possibly roll for an encounter. 

## Triggering Encounters
A dungeon is alive and will have creatures actively moving around it. Loud actions, triggering traps, or taking damage will garner the attention of the denizens of a location. 

The character who triggers the event should roll a *Saving Throw* of the GM’s discretion to see if an *Encounter* occurs. If the character fails their roll an *Encounter* occurs. 

### Wandering Monsters
Wandering Monsters occur based upon how dangerous the dungeon is and are checked on a per hour basis by rolling a 1d6. On a roll of a 1, a *Wandering Monster* encounter will occur.   

### Other Encounters
Not all *Encounters* must result in combat with creatures. Some creatures may be wiling to negotiate or make deals with the party. Other encounters could be environmental effects or other changes to the scene. 

## Torches and Light
### Bright Light
- Characters can see any reasonable distance cast in bright light.
- Torches provide a 20’ radius of bright light and candles will provide a 5’ radius of bright light. 
- Both provide no additional light or vision beyond that range. 
- Lanterns will provide 40’ of directional bright light 5’ wide. 
- Light sources last for one hour, unless stated otherwise. 

### Dim Light
- Characters can see a maximum distance of 60’ in dim light and can only see outlines of objects and creatures.
- Any attacks, magic, or skill rolls done in dim light are done so *Impaired* 
- If a torch or lantern is lit in *Dim Light*, any vision beyond the radius of the light source becomes *Darkness* and is no longer visible.  

### Darkness 
- Any area outside of a light source shall be considered in *Darkness*.
- It should be assumed that any dungeon or underground location will be in *Darkness* unless otherwise explicitly stated as being lit. 
- Characters cannot see or attack any creature in *Darkness*.
- Non-Human creatures can see and attack in *Darkness* 
- Any *Skill Check* or *Saving Throw* attempted in *Darkness* is done so *Impaired*. A *Skill Check* or *Saving Throw* that requires vision automatically fails and cannot be attempted.

### Light During Combat
- A torch can provide light for two adjacent combat lanes during combat, provided there are no obstructions. A candle can provide light for the nearest *Engaged* character in the *Combat Lane*. 
- Most light sources can be placed on the ground during combat provided the ground is not wet, however some surfaces may catch fire. 
- A lantern can provide light to one combat lane and can be directed with an *Action* to illuminate any *Combat Lane*

## Resting
- Characters can spend one dungeon turn resting to recover their *Breath*. 
- Characters can only rest in a safe location and must have *Bright Light* or *Dim Light* to complete a rest. 

### Setting up a Refuge in a Dungeon
- Characters may create a *Refuge* in a dungeon provided the location can be secured from monsters, animals, or the elements.
