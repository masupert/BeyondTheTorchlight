- While exploring a dungeon characters will take a dungeon turn in 10 minute increments. 
- During each dungeon movement, characters may choose to take one action each during the turn. Actions may include, but are not limited to searching a room, talking to a person, trying to hide, talking/conversing, or other similar actions. 
- Each character should act within a scene before the next character gets an opportunity to act again.
- During a 10 minute turn characters may explore one reasonably sized room within a dungeon, approximately 200x200’ of wilderness. 
- Characters may move up to 240’ a regular speed, assuming they are trying to be aware of their surroundings or 120 if trying to sneak or move without sound
