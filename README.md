# BeyondTheTorchlight
Beyond the Torchlight is a simple RPG system that is intended to be transferable across settings, with the intent to make a system that can be played in both fantasy, modern or futuristic settings. It will be focused primarly around a West Marches style setup and will allow for tools to build a town and branching adventures from that town.


# Design Concepts 
- Simple rulebook and character creation 
- Compatible with a variety of game systems with quick conversion guidelines.
- Develop a "magic" system that can be applied to various settings, including futuristic settings. 
- Invested in a rollplay
- Classless
- Single currency gold/credits/marks
- Downtime/non-adventuring rules for growth and character development.
