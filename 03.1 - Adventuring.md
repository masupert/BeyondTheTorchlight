# Adventuring
One of the most important things an adventuring party will do is to explore the wilderness around them, spending days or weeks outside the safety of their town. 

## An Adventuring Day 
 The adventuring day is divided into four *Phases*.
- Morning
- Afternoon
- Evening
- Night

During each *Phase*, the party may take one of the actions listed below for the location they are currently in. At the start of each action, the GM or a member of the party shall make a dice roll to determine if an encounter occurs during that *Phase's* action. 

### Available Actions
 - Travel
 - Explore
 - Forage
 - Setup Camp
 - Interact

#### Travel
The party travels to an adjacent  location to one they are on. Locations and features such as terrain, mountains, rivers, etc. are revealed on the adjacent location and may be revealed on further locations per the GM’s discretion based upon sight or weather. For example the characters are likely to see a very high and well known mountain peak on an adjacent location if the weather is clear. 

#### Explore
The party explores the current location/hex revealing up to a total six (6) features such as ruins, towns, caves, hidden groves, etc per the GM’s discretion. One feature may be revealed per attempt.

**Note:** Locations do not necessarily contain six features and a search could turn up no additional features. The GM may decide whether to keep the amount of features per location hidden. 

#### Forage
The party may choose to forage for plants, search for food or seek out fresh water if they are available on the current location. Items may not be available depending upon the terrain and the GM’s discretion. 

##### Foraging for Plants 
Foraging is searching for plants or herbs useful for the creation of potions, salves, or used in magic. Some plants are only available in certain climates or locations. 

##### Searching for Food
Party members are required to consume one (1) ration worth of food per day. The party may choose to spend one phase searching or hunting for food. 

Party members are also required to drink one unit of water per day. 

Roll 1d6 to determine how many rations or units of water the party is able to recover while searching. The party may choose to spend more than one *Phase* searching for food. 

##### Terrain Modifier
| Terrain | Rations | Water |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Grassland | 0 | -1 |
| Forest | +2 | +1 |
| Coastal (Fresh) | +1 | N/A |
| Coastal (Salt) | +1 | -1 |
| Desert | -1 | -2 |
| Mountainous | +1 | 0 |


#### Setup Camp
The party sets up camp to prepare for a rest. The party must rest for at least one *Phase* per day or they will gain one level of *Fatigue*.   

If the party is undisturbed they are able to rest and party members lose all their *Fatigue* at the start of the next *Phase*.

If the party is disturbed during their rest with an encounter or with another disturbance such as severe weather, they may only detract 1d4 *Fatigue* for the party. Fatigue may be recovered in any combination per the party members. 

#### Interact
The party may choose to interact with one feature that they have discovered inside their current location. This could be dungeon *delving*, approaching a town/village, lair exploration, a long NPC interaction, etc… 

Note: When interacting with a feature such as a dungeon the time spent exploring the dungeon can usually take place during this same phase unless your players explicitly state they will spend more than one *Phase* there. 

### Getting Lost
If the party is traveling through the wilderness to a new location, they have a 1 in 6 chance of getting lost. 
- After the GM describes the general information in the location, the party must roll a 1d6. On a roll of 1 the party arrives at the new location, but becomes lost.  

If the current location contains bad weather, or rough terrain add an additional point to the d6 roll. (e.g bad weather is a 2 in 6 chance, bad weather and bad terrain is a 3 in 6 chance.)

If the party is lost, they must spend an additional *Phase* trying to find their way, rolling a 1d6 with the appropriate modifiers for weather and terrain. Should the party fail their roll again, each character gains a level of *Fatigue*, and must attempt to find their way again at a future *Phase*. 

Note: The party does not need to attempt to find their way immediately after becoming lost. The may choose to setup camp or forage, but they may not leave their current location to explore, find new locations, or *Features*,  until they find their way. 

#### Fatigue 
If characters are unable to sleep, are deprived of a critical resources or challenged with an extreme condition such as weather, they will become *Fatigued*. When a character gains *Fatigue* it is added to one of their inventory slots. If they have no open slots available, they must drop a piece of equipment to free up an inventory slot. 


# Setting up a Refuge 
A *Refuge* is a secure set of supplies that players may create and place in the wilderness that will allow them to complete a rest to recover their *Characteristics* in addition to *Breath*. 

A *Refuge* can be a cave, an old hunting cabin, a secure room or any other location the players can secure. A Refuge may prove to be the difference between life and death when adventuring deep into the wilderness.  

Players will have to construct supplies from their town and bring them to the *Refuge*.

A *Refuge* is an expendable resource and each time the players use it, they expend some of those resources. 

- A *Refuge* requires 100 Coin to establish and 50 coin for each supply cache to be used. 
- A *Refuge* is 5 Inventory slots to transport and includes all basic necessities such as pots and pans, medical supplies, tools bedding, etc.  
- Refuge materials are 1 inventory slot for each use and contain all of the basic materials for food, repair, etc.

Players can spend one (1) Refuge Material per person per day to do the following:

- Rest and regain 1d4 points to all *Characteristics* below their max value.
- Repair Equipment and regain 1d4 points to Armor or repair any damaged *Adventuring Equipment*.
- Repair Weapons and regain 1 damage dice level for any damaged weapons
- Cure one persistent ailment such as poison, bleeding, etc. 


# Advanced Adventuring 
Traveling in the wilderness can be done either through a *Hexcrawl*, or a *Pointcrawl* depending upon the style and preference of the players. 

## Hexcrawl Procedures
The overland world outside the town is divided into a map covered with hex.

Characters may travel through one hex during each *Phase* and at most four Hexes in a day.  

If characters do not rest at least once per day, or if they are out of water or food, they will gain *Fatigue* in one of their inventory slots. 

In traditional RPG systems each hex consists of an area six (6) units across. This can be miles, kilometers or any other distance appropriate for the scale of your current play setting. 

Terrain, weather or other environmental factors may hinder or inhibit characters’ movement, induce *Fatigue*, or cause them to become *Lost*. 

## Pointcrawl Procedures
A *Pointcrawl* can be used as a preference over hexcrawl system or when locations/destinations are known in the world or when players are interacting with *Features* inside a hex.

Imagine a point crawl similar to a mind map, where important locations are identified as points or nodes. Those locations are connected with lines, that can range from roads, paths, overland travel, etc. 

In general the adventuring rules apply similarly to a point crawl or a hex crawl.
