# Traits
*Characteristics* and *Traits* work together during gameplay to further allow players to define who their character is and how they may act during different situations. *Traits* may be used during *Difficulty Checks* or *Saving Throws* or role-play to inform players how their character may act. *Traits* may also modify the dice roll in a positive or negative way.  

An applicable trait to a situation may add or subtract 1d4 to a  *Difficulty Check* or *Saving throw*. Traits can be both positive and negative to the outcome of a roll.

Players should select one set of traits from each Characteristic group to apply to their character.
