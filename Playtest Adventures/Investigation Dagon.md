M.A. Supert
Investigation Dagon
BTTL Version 1.00

# Introduction 
You and your party are members of the infamous Miskatonic Society. This secret society operates in the shadows of Neverwinter (or similarly large city), investigating horrors found within the city and along the coast of Faerun. 

Your party will all be senior members of the society, well known with their established contacts and history within the society’s walls. 

# House rules
Insanity: The adventure will use Sanity saving throws. Calculate Sanity as 10+ CON Mod. All saving throws are succeeded by rolling D20 UNDER your current Sanity Score (i.e. if Sanity is 14, a D20 roll of 12 would successfully save). Upon failing roll a D20 and see the Sanity Table for the appropriate effect. 
Death Saves: Should be rolled behind the DM screen and the result kept secret by the DM and the player making the saving throw.

SAFETY WARNING: Portions of this adventure can contain graphic or disturbing content or gore. It is advised to review the scene in Semyaza's Brothel before running this module and to discuss safety measures with your group prior to commencing this adventure. That scene can be toned down or removed if necessary.

1. Act 1
Act 1 - Scene 1: Miskatonic Society
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Introduction
The party is in one of the sitting rooms at the Miskatonic Society. The time should be approximately 9:00 PM in the evening or three hours until midnight or the equivalent in your world. The room is large, filled with oak wood paneling and several seating areas that various members may collect themselves around. Set the scene by describing the room in as much or as little detail as you like, setting the atmosphere. 
DM Note: Identify which players are at each location before moving on to the actions at each location. 
DM Note: This adventure is recommended to be played in "real time", allowing for 3 hours for the party to complete their mission. You can start the in-game clock at 9:00 pm or whatever is your equivalent to 3 hours before midnight. 
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Locations in the Room
A large fireplace sits on the north wall with two large, velvet armchairs angled towards the fire. Between the arm chairs is a small end table with the a Newspaper featuring the latest news of the day. 
Near the entrance to the room along the east side is a rectangular dining table with seating for eight. The table is ornately carved and polished to a shine. A small bar area sits against the wall with appropriate liquor or other drinks the party may wish to partake in. 
Near the southeast side of the room is a card table. Laying in the center is an Amulet of the Mind that the players collected from their last adventure. The amulet grants +1 to the player's Sanity score and once per hour, they may choose to decrease one other stat equal to the amount they would like to increase their Sanity. 
Once worn the amulet cannot be removed until the next sunrise.
Players at this table may choose to play a game of chance with dice. 

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Newspaper
Hand out the newspaper to your players sitting around the fire to read while the rest of the party operates in other parts of the room.
The newspaper provides clues that may be used later in the game with information about the “Paradise Lost”, a cargo ship reported lost at sea and the benefactor of the ship. 
The newspaper should not be shared with anyone else at the table and should be taken back by the DM at the conclusion of the scene, unless the characters specifically take it with them. 

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Game of Chance
All characters participating may roll a Dexterity Check, with the highest score winning. DM may determine who goes first, moving clockwise around the table for those participating. 
Players may utilize any skills, magic or items they have to either increase their DEX score or decrease the DEX of another player. 
Any ability, object or skill that is an ACTION may be used during their turn to roll.
Any ability, object or skill that is a BONUS ACTION or REACTION may be used on any other player's turn, consistent with their character's ability to utilize those abilities "per round". 
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Liquor Cabinet
Any player at the rectangular dining table may use the liquor cabinet to create a drink from The Great Big Random d100 Of Tavern Drinks (Google Docs Link) without any monetary cost. 
Have your player roll a d100, describe the drink and its effects. 
DM Note: Allow each location's actions to occur “at the same time”.

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Meeting Musgraben Shadowcloak
Once you are satisfied with the introduction of your characters, Musgraben Shadowcloak will enter the room.
Musgraben is the Master of the Miskatonic Society and is a rather stern individual, who often feels like he is the only "adult" in a room full of children. He has no hesitation to lay discipline into the party, but he is not an outright antagonist. 
He will inform the party that the society is being tasked with investigating an apparent suicide of a sailor over in Beggar's Nest. The party is being called in specifically because of the condition of the body.
Musgraben provides the following information: 
A sailor has been found dead outside of their apartment and appears to be changing in some way.
The dead sailor has webbed feet and fingers, and the eyes are beginning to black over. The blood is of a strong odor of fish and several of the city guard have already succumbed to some sort of condition due to touching the body.
Captain Farash Azaki has contacted the Miskatonic Society for assistance and would like the party to investigate the apartment that the sailor was renting. The city guard have secured the location, but have not entered the apartment. The Captain will meet the party outside of the apartment. 
DM Note: The party may utilize whatever means they wish to arrive at the apartment, which is located in the Beggar's Nest and is approximately a 30 minute ride via horse/taxi or 45 minute ride by walking. This should conveniently match to the time it took to complete your introductions in the first scene. 

Act 1 - Scene 2: Sailor's Apartment
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Introduce Guard Captain Farash Azaki
Introduction: The players will arrive to a dimly lit street located in Beggar's Nest. The city guard has secured the location in an approximately two block radius and vacated the buildings immediately adjacent to the apartment. The party will have to walk the final two blocks to the location in question. Three city guard keep watch down each adjacent street and in front of the apartment stands Captain Farash Azaki, looming over a dead body sprawled on the cobblestone.
Captain Azaki can provide the following information:
The landlord indicated the sailor has had physical contact with multiple people over the past week. Anyone in physical contact with the bodily fluids appears to become ill.
Azaki is expecting a report in the next few minutes from his team on whom the sailor may have been in contact with. 
He advises the party to please assist and investigate the sailor and his room. 
His team has not gone into the apartment. 


Investigating the Body
The sailor appears to have died from bludgeoning damage from jumping out of a window. They are lying face down on the pavement in a pool of black ichor.
Broken glass is strewn across the cobblestone and the party can clearly see a broken second story window. 
A black ichor spreads into a full five foot square. Any party member who makes skin to skin or other direct contact with the ichor must make a DC 16 Con saving throw. 
Upon failure, they are infected and must reduce their Constitution Score by 1d4 each hour or each scene in game per the DM's discretion. 
The condition may be cured only by Lay on Hands, but the ability score is not restored.
DM Note: If you so choose, do not inform your player of the DC or if they succeeded or failed the save. Ask for them to make their first save after they leave the apartment. You may choose to privately notify your player of the effects of the disease. 

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Investigating the Apartment
Description: The sailor's apartment is small, approximately 10x10’ and plain. No light except for the streetlights outside currently light the room. When entering the players see a small desk to their left with a chair, some paper and writing utensils. To their right they see an unkempt bed with a foot locker.
Opposite the door is a large window, broken and leading out to the street.
On the table is a Suicide Note left by the sailor. Any PC who reads the note must make a Sanity Saving Throw. If they roll UNDER their score, they succeed. If they fail, roll on the Sanity Table for their affected condition. 
Located in the foot locker is the sailor's personal belongings, including a rectangular Stone Artifact. The Artifact is approximately 18" long and 4" in diameter. It is wrapped tightly in 3" of oiled linen.
Any character that touches the stone with their skin, must make a Sanity Saving Throw.
If Detect Magic is cast by a party member the object emits a blinding aura, resulting in the character being Blinded until they release the spell. The object emits magic from the School of Conjuration.
The rest of the room is bare and contains only the sailor's personal artifacts. 
DM Note: Note that the suicide letter mentions the name of the sailor's ship called the Paradise Lost. This ship was also specifically called out in the Newspaper. 

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Stone Artifact
Description: The stone artifact is crafted out of a smooth sandstone type material. It is approximately 18" long and square shaped in its diameter. Worn carvings depicting unknown sea creatures are carved into the sides. 
DM Note: The stone artifact cannot be stored in a Bag of Holding or otherwise be transported from this plane, or be made ethereal. Should the party attempt to do so, they will take 2d6 Force Damage, from the resulting explosion of energy. 
If the party attempt to bind the artifact magically in any way, the binding will fail. 

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Next Steps
Once the room is searched have Captain Azaki call the party down  to the street indicating he has information to provide them. You can optionally allow the party to interview the Landlord, if time allows or have the following information provided by the Captain as needed.  
The sailor's name is Averus. He apparently had an opium drug addiction and frequently visited a brothel called Semyaza's
The name of the sailor's ship is the Paradise Lost and it is currently docked in the harbor. 
The captain of the ship is Wren Harbringer and Captain Azaki has the address and will provide it to the party.
DM Note: Don’t be too hasty to give out information, you can always provide more later with the Captain meeting up with the party again.

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Encourage the party through Captain Azaki to visit one of these three locations to gain additional information. You do not need to utilize all of them, depending upon time. The brothel may be added or removed as needed. 
Summary of information at each location:
Paradise Lost: Empty ship located at the docks. Characters can find additional information on the cargo carried in the hold, including its size and shape. They can obtain information on ship owner and who chartered the shipment. 
Captain Harbinger: Currently dying of the same affliction as the sailor. Can provide a verbal summary of the ship's journey and what happened. 
Semyza's Brothel: The brothel can provide additional medical information or context to a person currently converting from the disease/curse. The Party can gain information that the disease is spreading rapidly through the city from all of the sailors who sailed the Paradise Lost and can provide urgency to the mission. 
DM Note: Captain Azaki can be utilized to facilitate the game if your characters get stuck on what to do next. He can appropriately arrive at any of the three locations as needed. 

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Encounter: Lost Sailors (Map 1)
As the party leaves the apartment and walks back to their transport or to another location. Describe people on the street or the lack thereof. Shadows moving in an alley that are there one moment and then gone the next. You may optionally have the city guard who set the 2 block perimeter be unaccounted for. 
Description: As you continue down the street, out from an alley emerges a silhouette of three individuals. They sway as if unsteady on their feet, looking dazed and confused. Their skin is pale and their clothes torn as if they had recently been attacked. They reach out, as if seeking help, before they go stiff, their joints cracking in opposite directions and they dart towards the party.
--Roll a Sanity Saving Throw for all Players--
--Roll for Initiative—

DM Tip: This fight takes place in the streets of the city. The buildings are mostly two stories high and there are various objects in the street that may provide cover. The Lost Sailor's are extremely fast, so utilize the cover and the buildings to get a height advantage on the party. 
Their Ethereal Draw ability can be extremely effective to eliminate a dangerous foe from the combat and help manage action economy. 1-2 Sailor's per PC is recommended, but additional Sailors can be added as needed as a "zombie horde" coming down the street to push the players along or to heighten the tension. 
If a player is pulled into the ethereal plane, you can either require a spell to have them returned or allow them to return when the combat is ended, depending upon the makeup and skill set of your player's abilities. 
2. Act 2
Act 2 - Scene 1 - Visiting Captain Wren Habringer
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Introduction
Description: You find the captain in a poor state. His house is dark, the door is a jar. When you enter the home you notice upon the wall a painting of a handsome man in his mid-fifties. Straight jaw, dark black hair tied to a pony tail in a dress uniform. The face looks stern and confident. Clearly someone who has spent decades at sea and been successful at it. 
Upon entering you hear his moans and whimpers coming from upstairs. When you enter the room a stench of rotting fish and sea water hits your nose. You see the captain, laying in his bed, the sheets soaked and his hair slickened. His skin is a pale white and you can see the blue of his veins running through his neck. 
His eyes are darkened and he looks to be in an incredible amount of pain. Upon seeing you he reaches his hand out and with a whimper mouths “help me”. 
The captain is clearly on the brink of dying. The party has a limited amount of time to question him before he passes. The captain has the following information. 
The captain can inform the party that his ship was hired to pickup an artifact and then rendezvous with another fleet. He does not know exactly what the artifact was, but notes that he now realizes that it affected both him and his crew. Read the following: 
Quote: On the third night our ship rendezvoused with another fleet. The essence that hung in the air seemed to spread, reaching out to the other ships. At any passing glance any normal observer probably wouldn’t see anything as being off, but I can see now that the mannerisms, the very way in which the men moved, and spoke, and lived seemed to have changed. It was that very next evening that we hit the storm. The fleet was thrashed, with several of the ships lost in the night. The drumming of that low hum reverberated through the storm to an ear splitting level.
We arrived in Neverwinter two days later, the rest of the fleet I presumed lost. I have only just found out that it is in fact our own 	ship that was presumed lost. 

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Optional Information
The following information can be either found at the Lost Paradise at the docks or if time is critical, from the Captain himself. 
The ship was chartered by Count Cerac Regan Ferah.
The artifact was picked up from the Isle of Nandé from the Korrin Archipelago.
When the ship arrived at Neverwinter, the docks were closed to all other personnel and the captain met personally with the Count and his staff to unload the artifact. 

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Next Steps:
Depending upon time the party may choose to investigate either Semyaza's brothel or the Paradise Lost to gather additional information.
The party may have figured out at this point that all signs point to Count Cerac Regan Ferah and to the fact that he is holding a ball this evening for a grand opening of a tower. The party may choose to head directly there. 
If the party seems lost on what to do next, have Captain Azaki arrive to provide a possible suggestion. 




Act 2 - Scene 2: Semyaza's Brothel
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Introduction 
The players arrive at the brothel in a particularly rough part of town. Almost no one is found on the street and when the party approaches the brothel, they see that the lights are on, but activity seems quiet. 
If the party waits and observes the front entrance they will notice that no one enters of leaves the brothel. 
A player may cast Detect Poison and Disease and determine that the inside of the brothel is diseased/poisoned.
Upon entering the party will be hit with a wave of opium and the stench of rotting fish. All who enter must make a Sanity Saving throw and a DC 12 Con saving throw. Upon failure of the Con saving throw the player has the Poisoned condition while in the brothel. They may leave for five minutes to clear the condition, but upon re-entering must make the save again with a +2 to the DC for each additional attempt. 
Party members inside the brothel will be unable to concentrate while inside. 
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————
DM Note: The below scene can be very graphic. Feel free to embellish or pull back the level of gore or explicit content as is necessary for your group. 
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Description: The scene you find inside is one of almost pure horror. A thick opium cloud hangs above the ceiling and the humid air, full of decaying fish fills your lungs. The room appears to be completely soaked in salt water. The floor squishes under your feet as you walk and ribbons of water flow down the walls. A deep hum reverberates in the party’s ears while in the brothel. 
The patrons are strewn across the room in chairs, sofas and even the floor in various conditions. Some appear to be fine and merely consumed by the opium, their low moans of pleasure punctuated by lethargic movement. 
Others appear to be in various states of conversion showing signs of webbed hands, blackened eyes and even gills. Others still are torn open, their bodies splayed and being fed upon by those converted patrons. They lazily look at the party as you enter but make no move to attack. 
At the far end of the room you see a young woman, clearly one of the prostitutes. Thin silk fabric, soaked in water and blood lays across her body. Her arms and legs are splayed open and are being fed upon by three converted patrons. Her eyes are glazed over with opium and she calls to the party, seemingly not aware of her condition.

—————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Quote:(in a sultry voice) - "Well...What brings you all in this evening? Wait, I know what it is. You are looking for a little bit of release? Please, come join me, won't you? Come join Aira on the couch."
This is Aira Brighteyes, the prostitute Captain Farash informed you about. 
She can inform the party that Averus has been visiting the brothel for the past three days. 
She reports that he definitely seemed under stress.
If asked about the artifact in Averus' possession, she does not have knowledge of it.
She informs the party that most of the sailors from the Paradise Lost have visited in the past few days (alluding to how widespread this infection has already become).
The party can search the rest of the brothel without any resistance and does not find any additional information or artifacts beyond more bodies. 
If/when the party tries to leave Aira will try to ask them not to and will attempt to Charm at least one member. 
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Encounter: Aira Brighteyes (AC:6 HP:4)
DM Note: The party can escape this encounter rather quickly and with no conflict if they are careful and deliberate.
Aira will cast Suggestion on the party member who has interacted with her the most or who has the lowest Sanity Score. The player must make a DC 14 WIS Save, and she will instruct the party member to join her on the couch where they will become infected with the "Blood of Dagon". The party member will not want to leave. 
The party may choose to persuade, intimidate or use other means to convince Aira or their party member to let them and their party leave. The characters make either a Persuasion/Intimidation check with a DC 14 or a DC 17 if a member of the party is on the couch with her. 
DM Note: Allow your party to get creative if they so choose to try and leave as combat is not the objective here. Utilize the Lost Sailors for combat if required, but keep combat quick and the sailors inside the brothel. 
If Aira is killed by the party, 1d6+2 Lost Sailors will attack. 











Act 2 - Scene 3: Paradise Lost
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Introduction:
The Paradise Lost is at the Neverwinter port. The port is vacant at this time of night, with only the occasional passerby who pays the party no mind. Upon boarding the ship the party can explore two main locations.
Captain's Office
Shipping Hold
Description: The harbor is dark and an ill wind blows across the docks. The sound of rigging rattles on aged wooden masts and the heavy cloth of loosely tied sails flap against the night air. 
You hear  a ship bell tolling loosely in the distance  as water laps against the harbor. The party stands before the Paradise Lost darkened with no light beyond that of the dimly lit moon. 

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Captain's Office
Description: The Captain's office lies immediately to the right near the quarter deck. The door to the office is locked and can be opened with a DC 14 Sleight of Hand or a DC 12 Str Check. Once inside the party can find the captain's journal which will convey information similar to what he may have told the party at his home. If the party arrives here prior to visiting the captain, read the following information:
Quote: On the third night our ship rendezvoused with another fleet. The essence that hung in the air seemed to spread, reaching out to the other ships. At any passing glance any normal observer probably wouldn’t see anything as being off, but I can see now that the mannerisms, the very way in which the men moved, and spoke, and lived seemed to have changed. It was that very next evening that we hit the storm. The fleet was thrashed, with several of the ships lost in the night. The drumming of the that low hum reverberated through the storm to an ear splitting level.
We arrived in Neverwinter two days later, the rest of the fleet I presumed lost. I have only just found out that it is in fact our own ship that was presumed lost.

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Optional Information
The following information can be either found at the Paradise Lost in the Captain's journal or from the Captain himself.
The ship was chartered by Count Cerac Regan Ferah.
The artifact was picked up from the Isle of Nandé from the Korrin Archipelago.
When the ship arrived at Neverwinter, the docks were closed to all other personnel and the captain met personally with the Count and his staff to unload the artifact.

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shipping Hold
Description: The ship creaks and moans against the docks as the harbor can be heard lapping against the side of the ship. At the bottom of a dark set of stairs lies the shipping hold, now empty. 
As you enter the hold a deep humming sound penetrates your mind as described by the dead sailor in his suicide note. You reach out and grasp your head and the pain swells.  
A character that casts Detect Good and Evil can determine that the hold of the ship as been Desecrated. 
Any party member with a Sanity currently below 11 falls unconscious when entering the hold and must make death saving throws until they succeed or are removed from the hold, wherein they will naturally wake back up ten minutes later with no loss of hit points. 
Any party member with a Sanity level above 11 takes no effect and may investigate the hold. 
A DC 13 Investigation Check will determine that there was a single large object in the hold of the ship. A large stone object approximately 4' across and 18' long was housed in the hold of the ship. A roll of 17+ will determine that the object was made of the same material as the artifact found in sailor's foot locker (if the party unwrapped it) and that the object in the hold was an obelisk shape. 

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Next Steps
If the party has visited all of the other locations they should now make their way to Count Ferah's tower. If the time is approaching midnight or if the party seems lost, you can have the portal that will be opened at the tower occur at this time, and it will be visible above the tower through all of Neverwinter. 












3. Act 3
Act 3 - Scene 1: Graydon Tower and the Masquerade Ball.
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Introduction
Depending upon time and how much information your party as discovered they may be arriving to the tower during the Masquerade Ball, right at midnight, or even after the portal has been opened. The party may need to try and find a way onto the grounds or sneak into the party. 

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gaining Entrance
Graydon Tower and the surrounding property covers just over three acres. The tower is flanked on the east and west side by a manor house and library wings. The tower stands approximately eighty feet high and is in the shape of an obelisk. 
Not much is known about the history of the tower except that it has been in possession of the Graydon family for generations and has been abandoned and in disrepair for the last fifty years. Approximately six months ago the property was acquired by Lord Serac and restored. 
The property is surrounded by a 15' high wall with spikes on the top. If the party attempts to scale the wall they will find that the top of the wall is protected by an additional 10' high Wall of Force. 
The grounds are moderately landscaped and the party could sneak across them to the building if they attempt to do so. 
The grounds and front gate are protected by a cadre 2 Archmages, and additional NPC characters found on pg. 342 of the DMG as you see fit. 
A costume for the masquerade ball, with mask will be required for entry or to mingle with the patrons. 

DM Note: Encourage your players to try and negotiate entrance or sneak in if possible. 
Let the party think creatively by utilizing their resources, or access to the Miskatonic Society. Remember that they have extremely large sums of money and connections into the city. A player can certainly utilize the "I know a guy", an apprentice, a public persona (i.e. Bruce Wayne) or other means if they choose them to gain entry. 

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mingling at the Party
If the players arrive in time to mingle at the ball allow those who have good performance, charisma skills or those who chose a "Public Persona" the opportunity to mingle with the crowd and gain information. They may gain the following information with Charisma, Performance, or other checks as you see fit. 
Lord Ferah has not yet been seen this evening, but is expected to have something special for midnight. 
The main hall of the tower is currently closed and being prepared for this evening's special event.
Midnight
At midnight two hundred patrons at the ball are asked to come into the main hall of the tower. In the main hall you see a large sandstone obelisk in the center of the room. The interior of the tower is hollowed and the ceiling is open to the night sky. The obelisk sits on a 40' diameter platform with four steps rising up. Approximately four feet off the ground is a hole in the side of the obelisk roughly the size of the stone artifact your party has discovered. Lord Ferah enters the room.
Quote: "My guests. I am so glad you could make it this evening. This is truly a remarkable event. You have all been invited here to see the grand unveiling of Graydon Tower. A labor of love for the past six months and its restoration is nearly complete with the recent delivery of the obelisk you see here this evening. It is with much delight that the final completion, the final piece of the tower will be set tonight and completed, and I am delighted that all of you are here to provide the means to complete our task tonight. So without further ado..."
Ferah will gesture to an assistant who will bring forth a tray with a wrapped artifact on it. Upon unwrapping it your party may notice that it looks exactly the same as the one they found earlier this evening. Upon placing it into the obelisk a bright flash of light will consume the room.

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
DM Note: The artifact in question is in fact a different artifact than the one the party found earlier this evening. If the party does not have the artifact in their position at the mansion and they gave it either to the Miskatonic Society or to Captain Farash, Lord Ferah will have had his agents acquire it. You may choose to bring either Captain Farash or Musgraben Shadowcloack up with the artifact as a prisoner as you see fit and allow Lord Ferah to do as he wishes with them. However, they are not the focus of his attention this evening. 
Lord Ferah is prepared for this evening, so a cadre of mages will have counter spell ready if the party attempts to disrupt the ceremony. If the party does successfully do so however or he is killed, the swarm of patrons at the party will attempt to converge on the artifact and place the stone artifact as necessary. 
 








Act 3 - Scene 2: Dagon's Lair (Map 2)
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Introduction
Description: As the artifact is placed into the obelisk a bright light flashes in the room blinding everyone. The party wakes up a few moments later, no longer in the tower, but now laying on a plain of mud and filth seemingly in the middle of the ocean. The bodies of the two hundred patrons lay at the party's feet. Approximately 75' away the party can see Lord Ferah, standing next to an obelisk. A moat of dark, inky water stands between the party and Ferah. 
A bright radiant energy shoots up toward the sky from the top of the obelisk, where a portal approximately 100' in diameter and 200' above the ground is open. Through the portal the party can see the floor of the tower they were just in, as if they were looking down from the ceiling. The light the beam of energy from the obelisk in front of them connects to a similar beam of energy from the other side in the tower. 
All Players should roll a Sanity Saving throw upon arriving.

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Running this Encounter: The players will find themselves confronted with how to address the situation. If they have their stone artifact in their possession, they may be confused how to utilize it. If it is in the possession of Lord Ferah, he will hold onto it, but not utilize it. 
A close look at the obelisk on this side of the portal or a DC 25 Perception Check (due to the distance) will note that the obelisk on this side of the portal has an open space for an artifact. When the player's artifact is placed into the obelisk on this side, it will close the portal, but will also trap the players on this side. Removing one artifact on either side will reopen the portal. 
Unbeknownst to the players, Ferah has opened a portal and summoned Dagon from the ocean's depths to pass through the portal into our realm. The players will have ten rounds to figure out the puzzle, defeat the monsters at hand, and if possible close the portal and escape before Dagon does. 
--Roll Initiative--
Lord Ferah (Noble) (AC 15 HP 9)
2 Weeping Vortex

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
DM Note: If you have the space, start your characters approximately 75' from the center pillar in the map and prone. This map has very little cover for the battle with the Weeping Vortex’s.
Running this Encounter: The purpose of this fight is not to defeat Dagon. Dagon is an elder being and cannot be killed, but carries the general stats of an Aboleth with the following modifications.
Size Gargantuan with levitate towards the portal

Investigation Dagon - Supplementary Information

1.1 Premise
Premise (Dungeon Master Only)
This adventure will consist of party members of the infamous Miskatonic Society. This secret society operates in the shadows of Neverwinter, investigating horrors found within the city and along the coast of Faerun. Your party will all be senior members of the society (approximately level 16), and well known with their established contacts and history within the society’s walls.

The party is being asked to investigate the apparent suicide of a sailor over in Beggar’s Nest. They are being called in specifically because of the condition of the body, which appears to have webbed feet and fingers, and eyes that have turned all black. The blood is of a strong ichor and several of the city guard have already succumbed to some sort of condition due to touching the body.

5 Objects
5.1 Sailor's Suicide Note
I am writing this under an appreciable mental strain, since by tonight I shall be no more. I can bear the pain no longer; and shall cast myself from this garret window into the squalid street below. Do not think me weakling or a degenerate. When you have read these hastily scrawled words you may guess, though never fully realize, why it is that I must have forgetfulness or death.
Our ship, Paradise Lost was traveling with only a single piece of cargo, some artifact that was recovered from the isle of Nandé from the Korrin Archipelago. As soon as that artifact came aboard the ship, a heavy presence came with it, although none realized it then. The air felt thick and heavy, almost as if a weight was upon one’s chest. Some of the men swore they could hear a constant low hum, almost inaudible. Other’s couldn’t hear it at all. 
That night I dreamed I found myself on land. A land putrified by the slime of rotting debris and decaying fish. What lay before me was a circular plain, an island set in the middle of the ocean. The land sloped downward, spiraling into the center of the abyss as if a maelstrom and from that center I saw a large obelisk, the very same one we had aboard our ship. Out from it poured a column of light into the sky. I was drawn to it. Even as my mind called out in resistance that deep throbbing hum grew and grew. It grew louder until the pain and the pressure was unbearable. Then suddenly I saw it. With only a slight churning to mark its rise to the surface, the thing slid into view. Vast, Polyphemus-like, and loathsome, it darted like a stupendous monster of nightmares to the monolith, about which it flung its gigantic scaly arms, the while it bowed its hideous head and gave vent to certain measured sounds. It called to me, no, it beckoned to me. And I obeyed. I think I went mad then.
The humming has been steadily growing in my head, but tonight I cannot bear it. The end is near. I hear a noise at the door, as of some immense slippery body lumbering against it. It shall not find me. God, that hand! The window! The window!


5.2 Blood of Dagon (Disease)
An unknown magical disease that is affecting sailors from the Paradise Lost and spreading to other people who make physical contact with them. 
When infected the player must reduce their Constitution Score by 1d4 every hour. If their Constitution reaches zero or the character otherwise dies, they will turn into a Lost Sailor 1d4 hours after death. 
The condition may only cured with a Lay on Hands, but the strength score is not restored. 

5.3 Amulet of the Mind (Object)
A magical artifact that the party secured during their last adventure. 
When worn the amulet cannot be taken off until the next sunrise. 
The amulet grants +1 to the player's Sanity score.
Once per hour the player may choose to decrease one other stat equal to the amount they would like to increase their Sanity (i.e. The may decrease their Wisdom Score by -2 and increase their Sanity Score by +2).
